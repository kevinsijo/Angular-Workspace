            <p>Application of methods and procedures in organizations has been age-old. The efficiency of
                            an organization depends largely on evolution of adequate processes and procedures and
                            the ability of its employees to follow them. Accordingly, the efficiency of persons handling
                            secretarial work in an organization can be judged by their ability to dispose of
                            matters - mostly receipts, cases etc. with speed and quality, following the procedures
                            prescribed for the purpose. The ultimate object of all Government business is to meet the
                            citizens’ needs and further their welfare without undue delay or dilatoriness. At the same
                            time, those who are accountable for fair conduct of business have to ensure that public
                            funds are managed with utmost care and prudence. It is therefore necessary, in each case, to
                            keep appropriate record not only of what has been done but also of why it was so done.
                            These records serve as evidence, precedent, guide and training material too.
                            </p>

                             <p>The procedures prescribed in this manual, attempt to balance the conflicting considerations
                            of speed, quality, transparency and propriety. In a dynamic context, this balance
                            cannot be rigidly or permanently fixed. Every rule and step in the procedure must serve a
                            definite purpose and meet such tests: Is it necessary or sufficient? Is there any simpler
                            and quicker way to serve the purpose?
